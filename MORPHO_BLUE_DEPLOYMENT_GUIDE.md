---

## üî¥ WHAT'S LEFT TO DO

### Step 1: Deploy Smart Contract (15 min)

#### A. Prepare Environment Variables
```bash
# Add these to your .env file or export them
export RPC_BASE="https://mainnet.base.org"  # or your preferred RPC
export WALLET_PK_BASE="your_private_key_here"
export BENEFICIARY="your_profit_withdrawal_address"
```

**Important:**
- `RPC_BASE`: Your Base RPC endpoint
- `WALLET_PK_BASE`: Private key for deployment (keep separate from beneficiary!)
- `BENEFICIARY`: Where profits will be sent (use hardware wallet if possible)

#### B. Deploy the Contract
```bash
cd /home/benjijmac/l2liquidator

# Deploy MorphoBlueLiquidator
forge create contracts/MorphoBlueLiquidator.sol:MorphoBlueLiquidator \
  --rpc-url $RPC_BASE \
  --private-key $WALLET_PK_BASE \
  --constructor-args \
    "0xBBBBBbbBBb9cC5e90e3b3Af64bdAf62C37EEffCb" \
    "0x2626664c2603336E57B271c5C0b26F421741e481" \
    "0x33128a8fC17869897dcE68Ed026d694621f6FDfD" \
    "$BENEFICIARY"
```

**Constructor Arguments Explained:**
- `_morpho`: `0xBBBBBbbBBb9cC5e90e3b3Af64bdAf62C37EEffCb` (Morpho Blue on Base)
- `_uniswapRouter`: `0x2626664c2603336E57B271c5C0b26F421741e481` (Uniswap V3 Router)
- `_uniswapFactory`: `0x33128a8fC17869897dcE68Ed026d694621f6FDfD` (Uniswap V3 Factory)
- `_beneficiary`: Your address for profit withdrawal

**Expected Output:**
```
Deployer: 0x...
Deployed to: 0xYourNewContractAddress
Transaction hash: 0x...
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è SAVE THIS ADDRESS!** You'll need it for Step 2.

**Estimated Gas Cost:** $20-50 depending on Base gas prices

---

### Step 2: Update config.yaml (5 min)

#### A. Find the Base Chain Section
```bash
# Line ~190-250 in config.yaml
```

#### B. Add Contract Address
```yaml
chains:
  # ... other chains ...
  
  - name: base
    chainId: 8453
    rpc: !ENV RPC_BASE
    # ... existing config ...
    
    # ADD THIS:
    contracts:
      liquidator: "0x..." # existing Aave v3 liquidator (if any)
      morphoBlueLiquidator: "0xYourNewContractAddress"  # <-- ADD THIS LINE
    
    # Morpho provider should already exist:
    morphoProvider: "0xbbbbbbbbbb9cc5e90e3b3af64bdaf62c37eeffcb"
```

#### C. Verify Markets Are Configured
Check that these 5 markets exist in config.yaml (they should already be there):
```yaml
markets:
  # ... other markets ...
  
  # MORPHO BLUE MARKETS (should already exist around line 500)
  - protocol: morphoblue
    chainId: 8453
    debtAsset: USDC
    collateralAsset: WETH
    # ... rest of config ...
  
  - protocol: morphoblue
    chainId: 8453
    debtAsset: USDC
    collateralAsset: cbETH
    # ... rest of config ...
  
  # ... 3 more morpho markets ...
```

**If these markets are missing,** let me know and I'll add them.

---

### Step 3: Restart System (2 min)

#### A. Restart Docker Containers
```bash
cd /home/benjijmac/l2liquidator

# Option 1: Restart just the worker and risk-engine
docker-compose restart worker risk-engine

# Option 2: Full restart (safer)
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for containers to start
sleep 10
```

#### B. Verify Containers Are Healthy
```bash
docker ps
# Look for "healthy" status on worker and risk-engine
```

---

### Step 4: Test in Dry-Run Mode (2-4 hours) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!**

#### A. Watch Logs for Morpho Blue Candidates
```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch for Morpho Blue activity
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep -i morpho

# Terminal 2: Watch for candidates being detected
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep "candidate-detected"

# Terminal 3: Watch for any errors
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep -i error
```

#### B. What to Look For

**‚úÖ GOOD SIGNS:**
```json
{"protocol":"morphoblue","borrower":"0x...","healthFactor":0.98,"msg":"candidate-detected"}
{"protocol":"morphoblue","msg":"simulation-success","profitUsd":45.23}
{"protocol":"morphoblue","msg":"dry-run-skip"}
```

**‚ùå BAD SIGNS:**
```json
{"msg":"morpho-contract-not-configured"}
{"msg":"simulation-failed","error":"..."}
{"msg":"contract-revert"}
```

#### C. Verification Checklist
After 2-4 hours, verify:
- [ ] Morpho Blue candidates appearing in logs
- [ ] Health factors being calculated correctly
- [ ] Simulations passing (profitUsd > 0)
- [ ] No contract errors or reverts
- [ ] At least 5-10 candidates detected

**If you see problems, STOP and debug before Step 5!**

---

### Step 5: Enable Live Execution (5 min)

**‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY AFTER DRY-RUN TESTING LOOKS GOOD!**

#### A. Update config.yaml
```yaml
risk:
  dryRun: false  # Change from true to false
  # ... rest of config ...
```

#### B. Restart Again
```bash
docker-compose restart worker risk-engine
```

#### C. Monitor Closely
```bash
# Watch for actual liquidations
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep -E "liquidation-success|liquidation-failed"

# Watch for profits
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep "profit"

# Watch for reverts
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep "revert"
```

## üìä EXPECTED TIMELINE

| Step | Time | Difficulty |
|------|------|------------|
| 1. Deploy contract | 15 min | Easy |
| 2. Update config | 5 min | Easy |
| 3. Restart system | 2 min | Easy |
| 4. Test dry-run | 2-4 hours | Medium |
| 5. Enable live | 5 min | Easy |
| **TOTAL** | **3-5 hours** | **Easy-Medium** |

---

## üí∞ EXPECTED RESULTS

### First 24 Hours
- **Hour 1-4:** Dry-run testing, no revenue
- **Hour 5-8:** First live liquidations
- **Hour 9-24:** Ramp up, $50-150

### First Week
- **Day 1:** $50-200 (testing phase)
- **Day 2-3:** $200-500 (optimization)
- **Day 4-7:** $500-1,500 (full capacity)

### Steady State
- **Daily revenue:** $500-1,500
- **Monthly revenue:** $15K-45K
- **Profit margin:** 15-50% per liquidation

---

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

### Gas Costs
- **Deployment:** $20-50 (one-time)
- **Per liquidation:** $2-10 (Base L2 is cheap)
- **Failed attempts:** $1-3 (minimized by good simulation)

### Security
1. **Use separate keys:**
   - Deployment wallet: Can be hot wallet
   - Beneficiary wallet: Use hardware wallet
   - Don't use your main wallet for either

2. **Start conservative:**
   - Keep high profit thresholds initially
   - Lower them gradually as confidence builds
   - Monitor closely for first 48 hours

3. **Fund the deployment wallet:**
   - Need ETH on Base for gas
   - $100-200 ETH should be enough for weeks

### Risk Mitigation
- Dry-run mode tests everything without spending gas
- Smart contract has profit guards (won't execute unprofitable liquidations)
- Slippage protection on all swaps
- Owner-only functions for safety

---

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### If No Candidates Appear After Restart

**Check 1: Indexer Running**
```bash
docker logs l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep "morpho.*indexer"
```

**Check 2: Provider Configured**
```bash
grep -A 5 "morphoProvider" config.yaml
# Should show: morphoProvider: "0xbbbbbbbbbb9cc5e90e3b3af64bdaf62c37eeffcb"
```

**Check 3: Markets Enabled**
```bash
grep -c "protocol: morphoblue" config.yaml
# Should return: 5
```

### If Simulations Fail

**Check 1: Contract Address Correct**
```bash
grep "morphoBlueLiquidator" config.yaml
# Should show your deployed address
```

**Check 2: Uniswap Routing**
- Verify router/factory addresses are correct for Base
- Check if DEX liquidity exists for the pairs

**Check 3: Gas Estimation**
- May need to adjust gas limits in config

### If Liquidations Revert

**Common causes:**
1. Position already liquidated (someone else was faster)
2. Price slippage exceeded limits
3. Insufficient flash loan repayment
4. Contract not approved for tokens

**Solution:** These are normal in competitive environment. Monitor revert rate:
- <2% = excellent
- 2-5% = good
- 5-10% = acceptable
- >10% = investigate
