# L2 Liquidator Production Status

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RUNNING - Monitoring for Opportunities

## System Health

### ✅ Core Services Running
- **Orchestrator:** Healthy, monitoring 4 chains (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon)
- **Risk Engine:** Running
- **Database:** Connected
- **Redis:** Connected  
- **Prometheus:** Collecting metrics
- **WebSocket Indexers:** Active on all chains

### 📊 Current Activity (Last 5 Minutes)

**Candidates Monitored:**
- Multiple borrowers being tracked across all chains
- All candidates currently have Health Factor > 1.0 (healthy, not liquidatable)
- Policy retry system actively monitoring for HF drops

**Sample Borrowers Being Watched:**
- Arbitrum: 0xeb34ac1d25e4840c9d8998a0b341ec99e484b019 (HF: 1.17)
- Arbitrum: 0x4dd5548e35702a95a3c1d6106a20539984f78ea5 (HF: 1.23)
- Base: 0x732af09942e2641c80edf79aa377668afed43d8f (HF: 1.15)

**Execution Status:**
- ✅ No liquidations executed (no opportunities with HF < 1.0)
- ✅ System correctly skipping healthy positions
- ✅ Real-time monitoring active via WebSocket events

## Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Oracle ETH-Denominated Feeds (Deferred)
**Impact:** Low - Only affects LST assets (wstETH, weETH, rsETH)  
**Status:** Partial implementation complete, debugging deferred  
**Workaround:** These assets won't be liquidatable until fixed  
**Affected Markets:** ~15-20% of total markets

**Assets Affected:**
- Arbitrum: rsETH, weETH, wstETH
- Optimism: wstETH  
- Base: weETH, wrsETH, wstETH
- Polygon: wstETH

### 2. Policy Retry Noise (Cosmetic)
**Impact:** Minimal - Creates log noise but doesn't affect execution  
**Symptom:** Borrowers with HF > 1 being scheduled for retry then skipped  
**Root Cause:** Retry logic schedules before final HF check  
**Fix Priority:** Low - can optimize later

### 3. Aggregator Proxy Messages (Cosmetic)
**Impact:** None - Fallback handling works correctly  
**Symptom:** Debug logs showing "aggregator-proxy-fallback"  
**Root Cause:** Some Chainlink feeds don't expose aggregator() function  
**Status:** Already handled by fallback logic, just noisy logs

## What's Working

### ✅ Real-Time Monitoring
- WebSocket event listeners active on all chains
- Pool events (Borrow, Repay, Liquidation) being captured
- Health factor updates triggering re-evaluation

### ✅ Candidate Discovery
- Subgraph polling working
- Borrower positions being indexed correctly  
- Price feeds being checked (for non-ETH-denominated assets)

### ✅ Policy Framework
- Health factor thresholds enforced (only processing HF < 1.0)
- Retry backoff system active
- Market enablement/disablement logic working

### ✅ Infrastructure
- All Docker containers healthy
- Database connections stable
- Metrics collection working
- Log aggregation active

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Production Ready)
1. ✅ **System is Live** - Continue monitoring
2. ⏳ **Wait for Liquidation Opportunities** - Market conditions currently healthy
3. 📊 **Monitor Metrics** - Watch for HF drops below 1.0

### Short-Term Optimizations
1. **Reduce Log Noise:**
   - Suppress "aggregator-proxy-fallback" debug logs
   - Reduce policy-retry log verbosity
   
2. **Add Alerting:**
   - Alert when HF < 1.05 (opportunity approaching)
   - Alert on successful liquidations
   - Alert on execution failures

### Medium-Term Enhancements
1. **Complete Oracle Fix:**
   - Debug ETH→USD conversion caching issue
   - Enable LST asset liquidations
   
2. **Optimize Policy Retry:**
   - Add HF threshold check before scheduling retry
   - Implement exponential backoff properly

3. **Performance Tuning:**
   - Review and optimize gas estimation
   - Test MEV protection on Base/Optimism

## Testing Recommendations

### Mainnet Validation (When Opportunity Arises)
```bash
# Watch for first liquidation opportunity
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep -E "(healthFactor|executing|profitable)"

# Monitor execution
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep -E "(simulation|tx-sent|tx-confirmed)"

# Check for reverts
docker logs -f l2liquidator-worker-1 | grep -E "(revert|failed|error)"
```

### Manual Test (If Needed)
```bash
# Use harness to test specific borrower
npm run harness -- --chain arbitrum --borrower 0x... --dry-run

# Simulate without execution
npm run simulate-attempt -- --chain-id 42161 --borrower 0x...
```

## Metrics to Watch

1. **Capture Rate:** % of HF<1 opportunities executed
2. **Revert Rate:** % of transactions that revert
3. **Net Profit:** USD profit after gas
4. **Latency:** Time from HF<1 to execution (p95)
5. **Miss Rate:** Opportunities lost to competition

## Conclusion

**The L2 Liquidator is production-ready and actively monitoring.** The system is correctly:
- Discovering liquidation candidates
- Monitoring health factors in real-time  
- Enforcing policy rules (only execute when HF < 1.0)
- Maintaining infrastructure health

**Current Status:** Waiting for liquidatable opportunities. Market is currently healthy with all monitored positions having HF > 1.0.

**Next Milestone:** First successful mainnet liquidation execution when opportunity arises.
